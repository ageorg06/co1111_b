        <div class="test-section">
            <h2>1. Unit Testing</h2>
            <p>We implemented unit tests to verify the correctness of our API interactions and core functionality.</p>

            <h3>API Endpoint Testing</h3>
            <p>Our primary focus was on testing the API endpoints to ensure reliable communication with the Treasure Hunt server. The test suite is available at <a href="tests/api_test/index.html">API Test Suite</a>.</p>

            <h4>Test Cases:</h4>
            <table>

            <h2>2. User Acceptance Testing</h2>
            <p>We created a Google Form questionnaire to collect feedback from users. After gathering 50 responses, we analyzed the results to identify usability issues and user satisfaction levels.</p>

            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>Participants were asked to complete a series of tasks using our application and then respond to questions about their experience. The questionnaire included both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback fields.</p>

            <h3>Overall Assessment:</h3>
            <p>The heuristic evaluation identified several areas for improvement. The most significant improvements need to be made in system visibility, error handling, and responsive design for mobile devices. These changes will result in a more intuitive and user-friendly application that better meets user expectations.</p>

            <h2>4. Test Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our comprehensive testing approach has helped ensure that the Treasure Hunt application is reliable, user-friendly, and meets the requirements specified in the brief. Through unit testing, user acceptance testing, and heuristic evaluation, we've identified and addressed potential issues before deployment.</p>

            <p>Future testing recommendations include:</p>
            <ul class="findings">
                <li>Expanding unit test coverage to include more edge cases</li>
                <li>Conducting usability testing with a wider demographic of users</li>
                <li>Performance testing under various network conditions</li>
